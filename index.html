He helped to complete one of my songs. I am looking forward to creating with Canyon House Art Productions again, hoping this is the start of a long-lasting music friendship.</blockquote><figcaption>- Mick Dev</figcaption></figure><figure class="blockquote"><blockquote>Canyon House Productions is an amazing partner for all your entertainment needs. I've been working with Canyon House for over a year now. Canyon House produced 5 songs and 1 music video for me. You can view and listen to all Canyon House has done for me by searching Keytone (rapper) on all media platforms (YouTube, Spotify, Apple Music, etc.). Canyon House did all the instrumental engineering, track mixing, photography, video production, and editing. I've been recording music close to 20 years. I've made my own beats, produced and edited my own videos, write and mix my own tracks, and still didn't feel like I had the sound I was looking for until I partnered with Canyon House.<br>Nathan is the brains behind Canyon House Productions. Nathan is honest, reliable, fair, and listens to the artist. Nathan only asks for what is fair when coming up with contracts for his customers. His main focus is his reputation and he doesn't break his integrity for a dollar. You can only expect to have a fair and honest business relationship while working with Canyon House Productions. I have nothing but good to say about Canyon House. I highly recommend this company for all your entertainment needs!</blockquote><figcaption>- Keytone</figcaption></figure></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p class="align-center">Thanks for visiting!<br><br>© 2025 Canyon House Art Productions, LLC.
